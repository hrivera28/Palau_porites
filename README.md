## Data analyses of Palauan Porites cf. lobata - population genetics, growth and thermal tolearance 
This repo contains the data and scripts associated with Rivera et al. 2022, a paper on thermal tolerance and population genetics 
of Porites lobata corals across the Palauan archipelago. 

### Organization 

The repository is separated into a population genetic folder, which contains SNPs, microsatellite, and growth data; and a 
temperature folder, which contains temperature data and scripts. 

Within both folder there is an .RData file that can be loaded directly to avoid some of the initial data processing and begin 
with data analyses. 

All the input data that would be needed to run these scripts is included in the data folder. Intermediate files that can be 
generated by running the scripts with the included input data are not included. The only exception is the .vcf file for the coral 
host, which is available as supplementary file on the publication website. 

Final figures that are in the manuscript and supplementary data are included in the respective figures and tables 
folders for easy reference.
